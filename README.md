# DSCWOW_Mysurutourist
Hello!
This is team New Moon
There are two of us in our team: Srihari and Sabarish, we're both first year college students. We are learning HTML and CSS.
This is our first time developing a website and participating in a hackathon. During the course of the hackathon, we got to know
what frameworks are and learned a few classes from bootstrap and applied it in our project.

We have developed a website for the Mysuru Tourist Track.
Technologies we've used :
       <pre>      HTML
                  CSS
                  JavaScript
                  Framework - BOOTSTRAP </pre>

We developed a website, which displays information about tourist places in Mysuru.
In the home page,
      below the Nav bar,
      First, a carousel shows pictures of tourist spots, then an introduction to Mysuru and at last
      there are cards on places, which contain modals that more deeply specify about the places and
      the modal has location info.
In the second page,<!-- This is our Speciality-->
      We've asked few questions about viewer's individual possiblities
      Once the answers are selected and the form is submitted,
        EXCLUSIVE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE TOURIST PLACES WILL BE DISPLAYED FOR THEM
        
        ACTUALLY, this part must be done by collection of data and using ML to process the information, as we are learning, we dont know about Machine Learning
        So, we've defaultly set places for the answers using javasript in our website.
        In the near future, we are planning to apply machine learning in this field.
